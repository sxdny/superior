# Memory Game with jQuery - Sidney Silva 2ยบ DAW

Create a memory game using jQuery: the game consists of selecting two cards
and turning them over. If a pair has been found, their values are visible, otherwise
they are hidden after a short time.

Restrictions:
- [ ] All DOM elements in the body have to be created dynamically using jQuery.
- [ ] The number of cards must be random in each game, as well as the order of
the values taken by those cards (pairs of numbers).
- [ ] A message has to be displayed to the player when: the selected pair of cards
does not match, when it does match and when all pairs are found.
Extra:
- [ ] Instead of just one player, create them same game, but with two players.
- [ ] Use images instead of numbers.
- [ ] Create an animation in order to simulate that a real card is being flipped.

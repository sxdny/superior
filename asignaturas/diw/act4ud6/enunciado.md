We are asked to simulate the creation of post-its in such a way that we can classify
them in two different containers according to colour.

To do that we have to implement:

- [ ] Two containers with the droppable property. In them there will be a counter and only post-its of the same colour will be accepted.

- [ ] The creation and removal of post-its. These post-its will have the draggable
property.

- [ ] Clicking on a post-it will allow writing on it (there must be a control
mechanism so that the text does not exceed the size of the post-it, or so
that the size changes according to the length of the text).

- [ ] To create post-its there will be a button in the application, while to delete
them there will be an X on the top right of the post-it. Clicking on this
element will open a modal window (dialog) that will ask us if we are sure
we want to delete that post-it. There will be two options: one to confirm
and one to cancel.

- [ ] Another option for post-its is to minimise and maximise. An icon
representing this action will be placed next to the cross. If the post-it is
maximised, it will be minimised (so that only a part of it is visible) and, if it
is minimised (it will return to its original size). Some kind of effect must be
used when maximising and minimising post-its.

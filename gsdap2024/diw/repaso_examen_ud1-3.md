# Unity 1: Theory

## The importance of web design.
---
Having a well-designed and accesible website is very important for a company. It has a direct influence not only on the image of the company, but on the business itself.

That is why it is very important how we show the content to the user, how it is organized and how the web is presented to the user. This is what we call **web interface.**

A web interface is a set of all graphical elements of the web to make the experience of the end user easier and more pleasant.

## Visual perception.
---
Visual perception is the way the brain captures light-like information (things that we can see) from the outside and transforms it into a proper recreation.

Things like colors, fonts, etc; make a huge impact on our visual perception. The two possibilities that we need to keep in mind are:

- Which type of stimulus are interpreted in a similar way by all (Colors, fonts, etc.)
- Whay kind of reality is interpreted differently by different groups. (Culture, language, etc.)

Important things that we need to consider in the stimulus part are:

### Colors.
---
A color can be used to make something beautiful or to express an emotion, but is also has an important communicative function.

Important color properties:

- **HUE.** The property that makes the colors different.
- **Saturation.** The intensity of the color or putiry of the color
- **Brightness.** How dark of light it is (amount of light reflected).

For a color palette, the perfect amount of colors are between 3 - 5.

In order to choose the colors that can be more suitable of the design of a website, some techniques can be used:

- **Color recognition.** Colors that are used to reinforce the meaning of certain elements of the page.
- **Combination of different colors.** When we are about to create a color palette, we need to know how to combine them. We can combine complementary colors of the chromatic circle, monochromatic colors, etc.
- **Complementary colors.** Complementary colors are colors that work well together, creating a good contrast between them and making the design legible and beautiful. 

### Typography.
---
The best font type that we can use to make our website are *sans-serif* fonts. They don't have decorative markings or serifs on their letter and they are considered to be more legible on screens.

Things that we need to consider when choosing a font for our design_

- **Target audience.** Is not the same designing a website of kids or for adults. Some fonts can be more pleasing for kids, but not for adults.
- **Font type.** A font too wide or too cendensed loses readability.
- **Font size.** A font too big or too small can affect the readability. The perfect size is between 11 - 13px.
- **Style.** Font styles, libe **bold**, *italic*, ==highlighed== can mean a lot of things. Use them correctly.
- **Upper and lowecases.** Lowercases characters with individualized characters facilitare reading.
- **Spacing and line spacing.** It is important to know how much space we need to insert between letters. A huge or tiny space can affect the readability.
- **Alignment.** It depends on the language of our website. It is preferable to align the text on the left or center (better on the left).
- **Color contrast between font and background.** Using similar colours between text and background will make reading difficult. A strong contrast, light colors with dark colors, or highly saturated colors with low saturated ones must be sought.
